Wines, beers, spirits etc are ingredients.
But only if they're types such as 'burgundy' or 'abuzzo' or 'resinated wines' et.c

No branded products.  Digestives however are generic and can be used as an ingredient.
No taxonomic genus links - too broad to be useful, families or species only.
No endangered species of plant or animal, nor any plant / animal / fungus whose cultivation is environmentally catastrophic - what about cows though?  theyre cunts to gaia.    
No plants used solely for medicine, things that are eaten should be pleasant. 
^ regarding this, is food a medicine, does it make you feel better?
if it's a grape, use the wine made from it but only if its a single varietal.
